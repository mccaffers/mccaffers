## Introduction

In this post, I'm going to document how to setup a <span class="frontpage-span">C++ project in XCode</span> and test using the <span class="frontpage-span">XCTest</span> framework.

### Xcode

Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE), offers robust support for C++ development, providing developers with a powerful platform to create efficient and high-performance applications. While traditionally associated with macOS and iOS development, Xcode's versatility extends to C++ projects, offering features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools<sup>[1]</sup> tailored for C++ programming.

> <sup>[1]</sup> XCode provides debugging tools for XCTest (in Objective C and Swift), as I'll go into later on, by incorporating C++ in a Unit Test bundle you can step through lines and debug functions/variables with XCTest. I'm not sure it's possible to incorporate other test frameworks (like Google Test or Boost) and run tests directly within XCode

### Unit Testing ðŸŽ‰

It might sound strange but I really enjoy <span class="frontpage-span">unit testing</span>. Testing ensures code quality, reduces bugs, and improves overall software reliability. I've often found it easier to jump back into projects when I can start with running the tests and knowing everything works.

In the context of C++ development, where performance and low-level control are often critical, comprehensive testing becomes even more crucial. This helps catch memory leaks, optimise algorithms, and ensure that complex systems function correctly under various conditions.

## Creating a New C++ Project in Xcode

I'm going to document Step-by-step on how to build a C++ project using XCode.

> To note, I'm working with XCode version 15.4

To begin, create a **Command Line Tool**


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/create_project.webp"   />


Select **C++** as the language


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/select_cpp.webp"   />


You should now have an blank C++ project


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/empty_project.webp"   />


Lets add a C++ class to call in the main program, and then in XCTest


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/add_cpp_file.webp"   />


Make sure you tick to also create a **header file**


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/add_mathematics_cpp_file.webp"   />


### Adding the C++ Class

Next, we want to populate the mathematics.hpp and mathematics.cpp files with code to test

In **mathematics.hpp** we're going to add a header guard, a class, and a function:

```cpp
#ifndef MATHEMATICS_H
#define MATHEMATICS_H

class Mathematics {
public:
    static int add(int a, int b);
};

#endif // MATHEMATICS_H
```

In *mathematics.cpp** we are going to add the function with the logic code:

```cpp
#include "mathematics.hpp"

int Mathematics::add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

We can now update **main.cpp** with the logic to call the function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "mathematics.hpp"

int main() {
    int result = Mathematics::add(5, 3);
    std::cout << "5 + 3 = " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

You should now have three files, **main.cpp**, **mathematics.hpp**, and **mathematics.cpp**:


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/three_files_maths.webp"   />


You should build to check everything is working as it should, **CTRL + B** and to run **CTRL + R**

You should see the terminal with

```bash
5 + 3 = 8
Program ended with exit code: 0
```

## Adding the XCTests

Add a new target


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/add_target.webp"   />


Select a unit testing bunlde


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/add_unit_testing_bundle.webp"   />


Select **Objective C** as the language


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/unit_test_bundle_objc.webp"   />


Rename the testing file to have two m's. so **Testing.mm**


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/rename_testing_file_mm.webp"   />


Tick the target membership on the **mathematics.cpp** file so that the Unit Test Bundle is able to access it


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/tick_target_membership.webp"   />


In the test bundle, in file **Testing.mm** add the header:

```cpp
#import "mathematics.hpp"
```

Update the testExample function to call the Mathematics class:

```cpp
- (void)testExample {
    XCTAssertEqual(Mathematics().add(1, 1), 2);
}
```

The **Testing.mm** file should look like this:


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/updated_testing_mm.webp"   />


Change the schema to run the test 


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/change_the_schema.webp"   />


You can click the diamond next to **textExample** or run all tests with **CTRL + U**, you should see this output:


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/test_updated_output.webp"   />



You can now go back to **mathematics.cpp** and add breakpoints. Add a breakpoint to line 4 (the logic in the function), and then rerun the test.


<img src="/static/xcode_cpp_setup/breakpoints_in_cpp_code.webp"   />


Thats it! It's time to expand your codebase with more code, and <span class="frontpage-span">unit tests!</span>

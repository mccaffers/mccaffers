## Hi, I'm Ryan! 👋

I'm passionate about solving real problems through code, whether that's automating workflows, optimising trading strategies, or building tools that make developers' lives easier. 

I'm building solutions in various languages (C#, C++, Python & Swift) in my free time. I love tinkering with code, breaking things to understand them, and sharing what I learn. I believe in learning in public and contributing back to the community through open source and technical writing.

I hold an **MSci in Communication and Computer Systems**. In my final year, I designed and developed an Automated Landmark Recognition system in C++ to operate on a Pioneer 3DX Robot, utilising the wheels and camera to navigate autonomously.

My personal interests are in:

- **Algorithmic Trading** — Designing and engineering quantitative analysis systems in C#, C++, and Python

- **iOS & macOS Apps** — Native applications in Swift focused on developer tools and productivity
